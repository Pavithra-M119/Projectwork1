## Title of the Project
AI-POWERED DETECTION OF FAKE NEWS AND NEWS CATEGORIZATION USING NLP

## About
This project aims to tackle the growing issue of misinformation by utilizing AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detecting fake news and categorizing news articles into relevant genres. By leveraging machine learning models and linguistic pattern recognition, it effectively distinguishes between trustworthy and deceptive content. The system provides users with a reliable tool to combat fake news, enhance public awareness, and promote informed decision-making in today's information-rich digital landscape.

## Features
Fake news detection using NLP techniques.
News categorization by genre or topic.
Machine learning integration for improved accuracy.
Linguistic pattern recognition for deeper analysis.
Real-time analysis and feedback system.
## Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) to ensure compatibility with NLP libraries and machine learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the fake news detection and categorization system.
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow and scikit-learn are essential for model training and NLP tasks.
Natural Language Processing Libraries: NLTK and spaCy are required for efficient text processing and feature extraction.
Version Control: IImplementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use of VSCode or Jupyter Notebook for coding, debugging, and interactive data analysis.
Additional Dependencies: Includes NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for machine learning and data handling tasks.
